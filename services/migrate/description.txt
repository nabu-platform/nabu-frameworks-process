IMPORTANT: the servers should be in offline mode when migrating, if an action is _currently_ running while the process is being migrated, you can end up with errors in the best case or inconsistent state in the worst case.


The state MUST be mapped, otherwise the process goes into a situation that it can never progress.
So we will always want a to state id.


Migration strategies:

- stateOnly: only replay the current state, we don't replay actions within it. This is mostly relevant for long running CMMN-like processes where internal order is not really relevant
- stateAndActions: replay the current state and the actions, this is relevant when internal order _is_ important (default)


TODO: there are long running tasks (e.g. human tasks) that can block process migration. we need a standard way of dealing with this
TODO: add descriptions?
