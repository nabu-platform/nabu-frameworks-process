If we have incoming flows, we need to validate that at least one of them is done.
If we have outgoing flows, we need to validate that NONE of them are done.

However, if we have outgoing flows and NO incoming flows, we have a "root" action which can always be run as long as you are in the current state. Use maxOccurs to limit this if necessary.
This means, if we have NO incoming flows, we do NOT need to check the outgoing flows, because it doesn't matter what state they are in.
