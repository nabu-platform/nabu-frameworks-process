This service will fail if it is not allowed to actually run this action.

We want to allow service nesting where a parent service is the trigger and we want to track specific child services.
But because the parent is still ongoing by the time we get to the child, there will be no entry in the database (nor even a process instance in the case of a root service)

It should not be "reverse" in that a future action is running before this one. That would make the process weird.
