Suppose we have a batch service that executes the same step multiple times.
The first few times might be successful but then one fails.

In most cases that failure will bubble up and fail the full instance, hence rolling back all transactions.
In some cases you will work with batches where you scope a number of instances that might be successful AND committed
Then one fails.
You only want to roll back the ones that were in the rolled back transaction.

If you don't do anything and hitch a ride on the main transaction, everything will work except you won't see anything at all in case of error, which is not OK.
