Input captures can be used to identify a running process.
Output captures can be used to enrich a running process (also for further identifiers for subsequent input captures).

Processes are started on output and pushed further on input.



We generally scope transactions because we want the logging to appear, even if the service fails.
Note that when pushing multiple processes, they are either all committed or all rolled back. Suppose 2 processes allow it to continue, but a third process blocks the service call, we don't want to see start logs in the other 2.


We could do an insert when the action starts and an update when it ends, this has two disadvantages though:
- we have two database actions, especially the update can incur some overhead
- if the server fails, we have things that need to be rolled back.

For simplicity sake, we are opting to only do an insert when the service is done currently.
